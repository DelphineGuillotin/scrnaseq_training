# Introduction to Galaxy

In this part we will learn what is Galaxy and what are the main mechanistics involved in using it. 
We will start with [these slides](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/slides/introduction.html#1).

## Using Galaxy

We will start our practical demonstration by re-using this [introductory tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html).

If you are interested in further improving your Galaxy user skills, there are plenty more introductory tutorials [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/).

# Where can I use this later on?

Once you leave our premises you won't have access to our local Galaxy instances. All of the tools that we are using during this course
are publicly available at the [central Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) (most of them from our user [ebi-gxa](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ebi-gxa)), which means that they can be installed on any Galaxy setup.

## But where can these tools be installed?

- Public Galaxy instances: [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/), [usegalaxy.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/) and [humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/). There are more listed instanced [here](https://galaxyproject.org/use/). If the tools that you need are not there, talk to the administrators.
- Institutional instance: If your institute hosts a Galaxy instance, you can ask the administrator to install them for you from the toolshed.
- On the cloud: If you have cloud credits with a cloud provider, you can spin up your own Galaxy setup for the time that you need it through either [cloudman](https://galaxyproject.org/cloudman/) or the Galaxy-Kubernetes setup.
- Locally on your machine: if you have a linux machine and you feel comfortable with the command line, you can checkout the Galaxy code and execute `./run.sh`. This will be of course limited in terms of computational resources, but for small datasets it should be fine.
