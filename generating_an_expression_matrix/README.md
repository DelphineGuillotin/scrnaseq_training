# Generating an expression matrix for single-cell RNA-seq data

This session will show you the principles of the initial phase of single-cell RNA-seq analysis: generating expression measures in a matrix. We'll be using a setup based on Galaxy to illustrate the process for teaching purposes. The process is relatively simple given currently available tools, but there are some complexities we'll explain. 

## 1. Example data
