You can add more filtering boxes for other numerical variables and categorical (including booleans) variables. You can also add

using the Workflow `Read data and transform metadata` available in the `Shared data -> Workflows`. These are the sort of files that 
you would generate by the process explained in the Quantification module earlier on.
